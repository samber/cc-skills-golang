# Agent Skills for production-ready Golang projects

AI agent skills are reusable instruction sets that extend your coding assistant with domain-specific expertise, loaded on demand so they don't bloat your context. This repository covers **Go-specific** skills only (language, testing, security, observability, etc.); for dev workflow skills (git conventions, CI/CD, PR reviews) you'll want to add a separate skills plugin.

For generic skills, please visit [cc-skills](https://github.com/samber/cc-skills).

> [!IMPORTANT] Bootstrapped with Claude Code by distilling my Go project commits. **Edited, tested, reviewed and reworked by a human**.

> **No AI slop here.** AI-made skills are useless.

## 🧩 Skills

These skills are designed as **atomic, cross-referencing units**. A skill may reference conventions defined in another (e.g. error-handling rules that affect logging live in `golang-error-handling`, not `golang-observability`). Installing only a subset will give you a partial and potentially inconsistent view of the guidelines. For best results, install all general-purpose skills together.

## 🕵 Use in CI for AI-driven reviews

Add AI agents as PR reviewers alongside traditional static analysis. When configured with this skill plugin, the agent applies the relevant Go skills per review area — catching architectural drift, logic bugs, and concurrency hazards that linters cannot detect.

See [GOLANG-AI-DRIVEN-REVIEW.md](./GOLANG-AI-DRIVEN-REVIEW.md) for full setup instructions (Claude Code Action and GitHub Copilot).

## 🎯 Tuning Skill Triggers

If a skill triggers too often or not often enough, please [open an issue](https://github.com/samber/cc-skills-golang/issues) suggesting a description change. The `description` field in SKILL.md frontmatter is the primary triggering mechanism — small wording adjustments can significantly improve trigger accuracy. Some `SKILL.md` files might have a `When to use` section which is another level of exclusion. Finally, `SKILL.md` files are an entrypoint for lazy loading references with deep knowledge located in `references/`.

## 🔄 Overlap

Claude reports very little overlap between skills in this repo, thanks to cross-reference. I suggest enabling most of the skills and leveraging lazy loading. The recommended ⭐️ skills load ~1,100 tokens of descriptions at startup; full skill content is only pulled in when relevant. Note:

- I estimate that 50% of `golang-naming` and `golang-code-style` overlap with linters (golangci-lint).
- A large part of the security rules in `golang-security` have been distilled from the Bearer (SAST) checklist. The skill is still useful for methodology.
- If your team has its own conventions, create a company skill and declare the override explicitly near the top of its body: `This skill supersedes samber/cc-skills-golang@golang-naming skill for [company] projects.` Skills marked ⚙️ in the table above support this mechanism.

## ✍️ Contribute

- **100 tokens per skill description** - what? when to use this skill?
- **1.000–2.500 tokens per SKILL.md** — keep the main file focused on essentials
- **Use secondary markdown files for depth** — reference them from SKILL.md with relative links (e.g., `[Logging](./logging.md)`). Claude reads these on demand when the topic is relevant, so they don't count against the context budget until needed
- **Up to 10.000 tokens** for full skill and secondary files
- **2–4 skills loaded simultaneously** in a typical session — design skills to coexist
- **Stay below ~10k tokens of total loaded SKILL.md** anytime to avoid degrading response quality

For more guidelines, please check `CLAUDE.md`.
